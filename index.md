                For me, it is more than just the degree. It is the valuable technical skills, knowledge, 
                hands-on experience, and collaboration skills that I have gained and improved along the way.

                My favorite opportunity here was to engineer and develop a patent pending full-stack application
                for a private client, from scratch, while using an agile workflow in a small development team.

                During my summers here, I was able to get hands-on experience with the computers, systems, 
                and technology that drive the industrial automation at this company.
            - |
                I was able to experience PLC programming, the installation of PLC modules and electrical 
                components, maintenance of PLC components, as well as the setup and troubleshooting for 
                PLC components and user interfaces on new machinery.

                Started with my brother as a fun venture and experiment. I worked as the sole developer 
                for the mobile game that we created, Ultimate Power Drill Fighting.

                This was a fantastic experience for me from the inception, to the development, to the launch 
                for both iOS and Android devices.
